			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<article> <!--html5 semantic element-->
			<p>In 1912 a man was born who would later be known as the father of computer science. Alan Turing was a scientist - a mathematician, cryptoanalyst, and biologist. His most influential works occured in the fields of computer science and cryptology. Working with British Military intelligence during WWII, he deciphered coded messages which ultimately saved millions of lives. After the war, he worked at the Victoria University of Manchester to help develop the Manchester Computers - which included the world's first stored program computer. Following the work on computer science, he began research on mathematical biology. Shortly after publishing a study on morphogenesis, Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts. After having plead guilty, he received chemical castration as a form of treatment to his crime of gross indecency. The father of computer science passed away several years later due to cyanide poisoning, and was only pardoned for his crimes in 2013. </p>
